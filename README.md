I implemented 'push swap in python', as a way to practice my python.

FYI. 'push swap' is a project in the 42 core curriculum, and I find it to be one of the more interesting initial projects.
There were 2 goals that were in my opinion, just difficult enough to stretch my coding skills.

The first goal, was to sort a series/sequence of non-duplicate integers, within certain constraints.
For example, we have to use 2 instances of a particular kind of data structure. 
In addition, elements in this data structure could only be manipulated with specific operations (ie. aka 'push swap ops', see push_swap_ops.py).
The second goal was to reduce the number of moves (or push swap ops) as much as possible.
This led to helpful and fruitful conversations with fellow students, and I enjoyed this part of the project the most.

After having written 'push swap' once in C, for submission as part of the 42 core curriculum, 
I was pleasantly surprised that it took me about 2-3 evenings to hack together something that is working in python!
Albeit with a simple algorithm that will clearly be insufficient (in # of moves wise) to pass the 42 evaluation...
That said, I am encouraged by the progress that I have achieved so far!

As a side note, for the actual 42 push swap project, I only submitted the mandatory portion, and did not attempt the bonus portion.
So, this time around, I took the plunge and implemented the bonus portion, and wrote checker.py first, before writing push_swap.py.

Am considering to extend this project, to perhaps explore:
- employing alternative data structures, apart from lists, that I have started with
- implementing other sorting algorithms, such as the 'turk sort'
